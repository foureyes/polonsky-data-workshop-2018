## Data Formats

We'll be mainly discussing data available in __“human-readable”__ formats... 👀

Ummm... what do we _mean_ by saying that? &rarr;
{:.fragment} 

* {:.fragment} the physical file is formatted...
* {:.fragment} and the data is stored in such a way 💾
* {:.fragment} that one can open it in a __text editor__ (notepad, textedit), __and _actually_ read it__ 📝
* {:.fragment} sometimes, files that store human-readable data are called __plain-text files__


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Data Formats - Examples

Can you think of examples of some __human readable file formats__ and their __file name extensions__? &rarr;

* {:.fragment} __TXT__ (generally tab-delimited or fixed width)
* {:.fragment} __CSV__ (comma-separated values; comma-delimited)
* {:.fragment} __XML__ (Extensible Mark-up Language)
* {:.fragment} __JSON__ (JavaScript Object Notation)

Are there any other data formats that you've encountered? &rarr;
{:.fragment} 

Let's go through these formats in more detail! &rarr;

## .TXT and .CSV Files

__Tab-delimited__ and __Comma-separated__ values files (.txt and .csv respectively) are widely available on-line and from a variety of data sources.

These files are “human-readable” and can be easily imported into spreadsheets and databases. ... Some examples:
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} [Tab-delimited: U.S. Census School districts](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html)
* {:.fragment} [Comma-separated values or comma-delimited: NYC Open data list of colleges](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Colleges-and-Universities/4kym-4xw5) 

__Let's check out some of these files in a text editor, as well as a spreadsheet...__ &rarr;

## .TXT and .CSV Files Continued


__What are some observations that you can make about these files?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} they may or may not have a first row composed of __headers__
* {:.fragment} sometimes the headers may be difficult to interpret without __companion documentation__ or a __data dictionary__
	* {:.fragment} here's a _crazy_ example of some very [thorough documentation](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/samples/NORMAL_HLY_sample_ascii.dat)
* {:.fragment} CSV can mean _delimited by a character other than comma!_ (😲)
* {:.fragment} what if you want the separator character in your actual data? (one strategy is to quote it with double quotes)
